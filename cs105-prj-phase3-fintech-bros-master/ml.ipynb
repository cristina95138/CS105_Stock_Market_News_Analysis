One other observation is that sentiment analysis doesn't appear to be a good feature at first glance. All models had an accuracy of 52-53%. Though maybe this is actually good for a single feature. As we know, predicting the stock market is hard and other features need to be considered before disregarding sentiment analysis. \n",

    "So it appears that models that use moving averages are only slighly better at predicting the DJIA, by 1% greater accuracy. Though just like the sentiment analysis based models, these models are really good at finding true positives and false positives. Leading me to believe that the models have a hard time finding a connection between the features and the DJIA value going down. "
